I have to make a linked list of edges and then make a hash table with a collision avoidance strategy 
using linked list for items with same hashes. Hash table of nodes.

id goes up to 1 and stops there should be fixed
when inserted with n ni nj 2 then ni and nj doesn't exist in the hash table for some reasson
I have to get rid of the ids in the edges and make the linked list better
